# CppBodyMatlabGUI

1. abstract

Cpp application program with Matlab GUI. It depends on install Matlab in the computer when ever compile and run. In this case , we use Matlab2013a and Netbeans 8.2 and mingw g++ 8.1 Eigen 3.3.7. Maybe you want to use VS , that is ok. Are you OK? hahaha

If you use visual studio, please uncompress the file Eigen.zip

2. Open Project Solution
	1) netbeans - open projection direction : prj_cpp_matlab
		* run prepare.bat
	2) visual studio - open cm_demo1\cm_demo1.sln
		* uncompress the file Eigen.zip manually
		
3. this solution is based on matlab x86 libary, so the solution should change to be X86 in the IDE .
